    <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>
       This paragraph and this HTML code overall is only meant for testing purposes. These texts are only written to fill in the blanks of the paragraph section
       and to be displayed as a demonstration for said code. There is absolutely no reason for you to read this entirely, rather just go inspect the elements
       featured in this website. If media elements are implemented, check for compatibility and use your web browser's key inspector to receive feedback and
       warning about the code used.

     <h3>Samples of Work</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
      Thanks to HTML5 and CSS3, it is now alot easier manipulate text on an individual level as well as providing backgrounds and
      customization according to the developer's needs.Sadly most of these features are either not supported by the browsers or not avalaible
      on the code editor so you're expected to see plain, slighty modified text.

     <h3>Some article I saw online...</h3>

       Geary, 28, who has cerebral palsy, has long felt the limitations of other people’s expectations. When he was in college, people would ask: “Why are you here? No one’s going to hire you.” In job interviews, he said, he felt pressured to downplay his disability because he didn’t want to be perceived as a burden. And when he wound up unhappy in a job that didn’t match his skill set, he was told to grin and bear it, because “people like you don’t get jobs like this.”
       But everything changed after Geary connected with InReturn Strategies, a start-up intent on making hiring more inclusive by bridging the gaps between employers and job candidates with disabilities. Its founder, Jim Atwater, helped Geary prepare for interviews, showing him how his perspective and experiences could be an asset to potential employers.
       Now, Geary works at the Cerner research group, where his decades of experience navigating the medical system inform his work as a health-care data analyst. He said he’s happier than he has ever been.
       “For me, it means that I can start building the life that I want,” Geary said, “rather than having to go along with what other people had planned for me.”
        Diversity job openings fell nearly 60% after the coronavirus. Then came the Black Lives Matter protests.
        About 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.
        Atwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what’s known as “the disability employment gap.” As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers. He says members of this demographic are often the last to be hired and the first to be let go, and they are often relegated to jobs below their skill level.
        “There’s lots of people talking about inclusion and making tons of money from consulting, but very few people are doing anything about it,” Atwater said. “We are the mechanism to turn intent into action.”
         Research shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms’ bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 8 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.
         If the number of people with disabilities in the labor force grew just 1 percent, the nation’s gross domestic product could expand by as much as $25 billion, the Accenture report found.
         Companies looking to hire workers with disabilities usually follow traditional hiring channels, which often include processes that can be exclusionary. Meanwhile, access providers — organizations offering services to people with disabilities — don’t tend to have many connections in the private sector.
         “We’re building bridges where there aren’t any,” said Scott Brouillette, InReturn’s chief executive. “How are you going to hire someone you don’t understand and have no relationships with?”eople treated him as though he’d be lucky to have any job at all.
