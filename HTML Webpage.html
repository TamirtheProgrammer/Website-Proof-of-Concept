 <p1>
 This paragraph and this HTML code overall is only meant for testing purposes. These texts are only written to fill in the blanks of the paragraph section
 and to be displayed as a demonstration for said code. There is absolutely no reason for you to read this entirely, rather just go inspect the elements
 featured in this website. If media elements are implemented, check for compatibility and use your web browser's key inspector to receive feedback and
 warning about the code used.

 <h2>Samples of Work</h2>
  <p2>
  Thanks to HTML5 and CSS3, it is now alot easier manipulate text on an individual level as well as providing backgrounds and
  customization according to the developer's needs.Sadly most of these features are either not supported by the browsers or not avalaible
  on the code editor so you're expected to see plain, slighty modified text.
